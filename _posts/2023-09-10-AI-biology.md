It is beyond any reasonable doubt that machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL), harbors immense expressive power to learn any input-output mapping. ML/DL/AI models are becoming general-purpose tools for all application domains with ample supplies of data. The road ahead appears bright and clear—we need only to wield the “AI hammer” and strike every nail in our path. Now, let's get the "snail".
