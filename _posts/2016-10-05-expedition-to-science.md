In retrospect of all the papers I have published (a rather small number), the one I like the most is perhaps the 2013 Biophysical Journal article on ion competition in DNA arrays. It was a long wait of seven years since 2006 when I aspired to be able to formulate theories based on my own experimental data, no matter how trivial the theory may seem. Sadly, such theory/experiment research is no longer my current focus, because the complexity of the molecular system under study doesn't lend itself to simplistic treatise, at least from my naive perspective. This internal struggle is probably the subconscious drive for my recent forays into method development and medical physics. Searching for the dream science may well be a life-long process.
