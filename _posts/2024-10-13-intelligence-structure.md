Human intelligence rests on a collective network of neuron cells. Crucially, all neuron cells share the same underlying sets of genes and the same rules of gene regulation. The differeces between the cells, i.e., what amounts to the specialization of each cell, are the different moods/modes of functional configuration they are in. In other words, human intelligence appears to be the result of superposition, specifically, by superposing the sets of rather limited functions/genes (20K genes vs. ~12K embedding size in GPT-3) in a structured way. 

What is the structure then, if any?  I speculate that, the structure of human genome may offer some insights. It is the complicated, extreme "overhead" of regulatoion of the genes, only 1-2% of human genome, that makes up the bulk of genome and actually gives rise to the "cognitive behaviors" we perceive as intelligence.
